# Cisco Networking Labs

This repository contains a collection of networking labs completed as part of the **Computer Systems** module.  
All labs are built using **Cisco Packet Tracer** and focus on practical networking concepts such as topology design, VLANs, routing, DHCP, and network security.

## Labs

### 1. Network Topologies
- Explore **bus, star, ring, mesh, and hybrid** topologies
- Learn about scalability, fault tolerance, and performance trade-offs
- Practice device setup, cabling, IP addressing, and connectivity testing

### 2. Router and Subnet Configuration
- Designed a **four-subnet topology** connected via a central router  
- Configured **default gateways** and **subnets** for each network segment  
- Verified end-to-end connectivity between PCs across subnets using **ping** and **traceroute**  
- Implemented logical segmentation using **Switch-PT** and **Router-PT** devices  
- Demonstrated basic **inter-network communication** setup and subnet isolation
